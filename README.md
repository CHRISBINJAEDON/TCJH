## 🔥 Tagline  
“Protecting People, Preserving Wildlife — Turning Safety into Sustainable Wealth for the Global Majority.”

## 📘 Overview  
Smart Safety for Forest-Edge Economies is a smart, eco-friendly handheld torch designed to reduce human–wildlife conflict in forest-fringe communities. It uses red LED flashes, artificial flame visuals, and sound effects to safely deter wild animals without harming biodiversity. Future upgrades include IoT sensors, blockchain-based incident reporting, and predictive analytics—creating a scalable safety network for rural economies.

## 💡 Inspiration  
In India, over 300 million people live near forests, where human–animal conflict causes annual crop losses exceeding ₹1,000 crore. Traditional deterrents are unsafe, expensive, and harmful to the environment. Our solution is community-friendly, sustainable, and aligned with the UN SDGs.

## 💰 Economic Problem Addressed  
- Crop and livestock loss  
- Compensation inefficiencies  
- Insurance gaps  
- Resource misallocation  

## 🎯 Target Users  
- Rural farmers  
- Forest-fringe communities  
- Forest departments  
- Wildlife NGOs  
- Insurance programs  

## 🛠️ Use Cases  
- Nighttime protection of crops and livestock  
- Automated alerts for wildlife intrusion  
- Verified incident reporting  
- Data collection for economic modeling  
- Integration with micro-insurance platforms
